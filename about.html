            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>The <a href="index.html">South Carolina Hurricanes and Tropical Storms application</a> lets you search for and view information for over 300 years of hurricanes and tropical storms that have impacted South Carolina. You will find storm track data for all storms after 1851, when official records began. In addition, information and comments specific to South Carolina are included, which make this a very rich dataset for the State of South Carolina and beyond.</p>
        
            <h3>Get Data</h3>
            <p>The historical track data in this application were compiled from <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html">National Hurricane Center Hurricane Data, 2nd Edition</a> (HURDAT2) and modified by the South Carolina State Climate Office for use with this application. Additionally, the State Climate Office compiled information for storms prior to 1851. No storm track data are available for these storms, but information about their impacts to South Carolina can be found in the application.</p>
                <p>
                Storm track lines were generated by 'connecting the dots' between HURDAT2 advisories, which are point data. The GIS web services used in this application, which includes HURDAT2 point data and the tracklines with storm summary data, are publicly available and can be <a href="https://scdnr.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d615a6c6284b476c94aa908a6d7d91a6">viewed on ArcGIS Online</a>.</p>
        
            <h3>Explanations of Data</h3>
            <h4 class="ml-1">Storm Details</h4>
        <p class="ml-3">Storm details and summary information were obtained from HURDAT2 database and other sources compiled by the SCO. Please see the <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/newhurdat-format.pdf" target="_blank">HURDAT2 documentation</a> for more precise definitions of these data fields.</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Storm Name</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Official Storm Name, from HURDAT2</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Storm Year</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Year the storm occured, from HURDAT2</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Max Category</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Maximum status and category that was reached at any time during the storm's duration. Storm status was obtained from HURDAT2. Category is shown if the storm reached hurricane status. The category was calculated by SCO staff from the wind speeds given in HURDAT2 using the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Max Wind</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Maximum sustained surface wind recorded during the storm's duration, from HURDAT2. Units are originally in knots in HURDAT2, but converted to miles per hour (mph) for the web application.</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Min Pressure</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Mininum central pressure recorded during the storm's duration, from HURDAT2. Units are in millibars.</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Landfall Locations</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Landfall locations were obtained from a variety of sources compiled by SCO staff. Some landfalls are recorded in HURDAT2. Others were taken from the the resources below, or by viewing the track and giving a best estimate of landfall location. All landfalls are approximate and may not represent official National Hurricane Center landfalls.</p>
       
        <h4 class="ml-1">South Carolina Impacts</h4>
            <h5 class="ml-2">SC Impacts Dates</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Dates when the storm is estimated to have impacted the State of South Carolina. SCO staff compiled this information over the years from a variety of sources.</p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">SC Impacts Category</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Storm status and category as the storm impacted the State of South Carolina. There are many variables that influence the impacts of a tropical storm or hurricane on any one place. A best estimate is made as to the storm's status and category during impacts recorded to the state, but it should be noted that impacts do not necessarily correlate directly with storm category. For example, Irma in 2017 was downgraded to a tropical storm before it moved 200 miles southwest of South Carolina, but it brought heavy rains, strong winds, a very large storm surge, and significantly impacted the State. </p>
            <h5 class="ml-2">Comments</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Comments are provided here that give a brief summary of the storm's impact to South Carolina. Comments have been recorded by SCO staff over the years. Where storms did not already have a comment, SCO staff wrote a comment using the resources below as reference.</p>

        <h4 class="ml-1">Storm Advisories</h4>
        <p class="ml-3">Storm advisories are the points in HURDAT2, which are observations of a storm from the National Hurricane Center. The fields from HURDAT shown in this application are as follows. </p>
        <h5 class="ml-2">Date &amp; Time</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Date and time of the observation, generally corresponding to the synoptic times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800. </p>
        <h5 class="ml-2">Status</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">The status of a storm system is determined by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Options for this data field are below. See the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml" target="_blank">NHC glossary for definitions of these status terms.</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>TD – Tropical cyclone of tropical depression intensity (&lt; 34 knots) </li>
            <li>TS – Tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity (34-63 knots) </li>
            <li>HU – Tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity (&ge; 64 knots) </li>
            <li>EX – Extratropical cyclone (of any intensity) </li>
            <li>SD – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical depression intensity (&lt; 34 knots)</li>
            <li>SS – Subtropical cyclone of subtropical storm intensity (&ge; 34 knots) </li>
            <li>LO – A low that is neither a tropical cyclone, a subtropical cyclone, nor an extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)</li>
            <li>WV – Tropical Wave (of any intensity) </li>
            <li>DB – Disturbance (of any intensity) </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ml-3">Storm advisories are shown on the map in the Storm Details view. Different icons are shown for all hurricane categories and tropical storm status. All other statuses are grouped together and use one symbol, a red capital letter 'L'. </p>
        <h5 class="ml-2">Wind</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Maximum sustained surface wind.</p>
        <h5 class="ml-2">Pressure</h5>
        <p class="ml-3">Central pressure.</p>
        <h5 class="ml-3">Tornadoes</h5>
        <p>The number of tornadoes recorded in South Carolina as a result of the tropical storm or hurricane. This information was compiled by the SCO staff.</p>
