            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>This application lets you search for and view information for over 300 years of hurricanes and tropical storms that have impacted South Carolina. You will find storm track data for all storms after 1851, when official records began. In addition, information and comments specific to South Carolina are included, which make this a very rich dataset for the State of South Carolina and beyond.</p>
        
            <h3>Get Data</h3>
            <p>The historical track data in this application were compiled from <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html">HURDAT2</a> and modified by the South Carolina State Climate Office for use with this application. Additionally, the State Climate Office compiled information for storms prior to 1851. No storm track data are available for these storms, but information about their impacts to South Carolina can be found in the application.</p>
                <p>
                The GIS web services used in this application are publicly available and can be <a href="https://scdnr.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d615a6c6284b476c94aa908a6d7d91a6">viewed on ArcGIS Online</a>.</p>

            <h4>Storm Details</h4>
        
            <h5>Storm Name</h5>
        <p>Official Storm Name from HURDAT2</p>
            <h5>Storm Year</h5>
        <p>Year the storm occured.</p>
            <h5>Max Category</h5>
        <p>Maximum status and category that was reached at any time during the storm's duration. Storm status was obtained from HURDAT2. Category was given if the storm reached hurricane status, and the category was calculated from the wind speeds given in HURDAT2 using the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.</p>
            <h5>Max Wind</h5>
        <p>Maximum wind recorded during the storm's duration, obtained from HURDAT2. Units are in knots in HURDAT2, but converted to miles per hour (mph) for the web application.</p>
            <h5>Min Pressure</h5>
        <p>Mininum pressure recorded during the storm's duration, obtained from HURDAT2. Units are in millibars.</p>
            <h5>Landfall Locations</h5>
        <p>Landfall locations were obtained from a variety of sources compiled by South Carolina State Climate Office staff.</p>
        
            <h5>SC Impacts Dates</h5>
        <p>Dates when the storm is estimated to have impacted the State of South Carolina. The South Carolina State Climate Office compiled this information over the years from a variety of sources.</p>
            <h5>SC Impacts Category</h5>
